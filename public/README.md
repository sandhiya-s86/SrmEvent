# Static assets served by Vite

Put any files here to serve them directly via the web server.

Example: public/host.html is available at /host.html.

You can add folders like:
- public/images/ for images → /images/...
- public/docs/ for PDFs and downloads → /docs/...
- public/media/ for audio/video → /media/...

Tips:
- Avoid naming conflicts with build outputs.
- For SPA routes, use the React app; use public/ for static files only.
